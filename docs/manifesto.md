# Arc Manifesto

Arc is built on clarity, restraint, and responsibility.

- Calm UX, not noise.
- Professional engineering, not hacks.
- Explicit architecture, not magic.
- Documentation as a first-class feature.

Arc aims to be:

- Fast, but never rushed.
- Secure, but never opaque.
- Minimal, but never empty.
- Beautiful, but never distracting.

Everything is documented so others can learn how real systems are built.
