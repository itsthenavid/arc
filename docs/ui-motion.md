# Motion System

Motion exists to communicate state, not to decorate.

## Timing tokens

- Fast: 120–160 ms
- Base: 180–240 ms
- Slow: 280–420 ms

## Curves

- Primary: ease-out cubic

## Rules

- No infinite animations
- No heavy motion in scrollable lists
- Animations must never block interaction
